# ArcInventory Extension: Variable Grid System

## Overview
This folder contains code snippets and reference implementations for extending ArcInventory to support variable grid-sized items. The implementation draws inspiration from inventory systems found in popular games like Diablo and Escape From Tarkov, where items can occupy different numbers of grid slots based on their size and shape.

## Purpose
This extension leverages ArcInventory's robust backend architecture (which utilizes a system similar to Lyra's fragment system) to implement a more flexible inventory solution for games requiring sophisticated item management.

## Important Note
⚠️ The code in this repository is intended for educational and reference purposes only. It is not production-ready and cannot be used as-is in a project. These snippets demonstrate implementation concepts that developers can adapt for their specific needs.


## Features

* Support for items of various dimensions (1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 2x3, etc.)
* Grid-based collision detection for item placement
* Visual representation of variable-sized items in inventory UI
* Integration with ArcInventory's existing fragment-based architecture

## Dependencies

[ArcInventory](https://www.fab.com/listings/ee4027dd-0a9f-4ac9-a7e6-78994f67c133) has a solid backend inspired similiar to Lyra's fragment system.
